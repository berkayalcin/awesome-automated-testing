## What Is My Hated Testing Story ?

After starting the software and improving myself a bit, I initially thought it was unnecessary to write tests until I had to do freelance work and maintain these projects.
I realized how much time it took to control the consistency of the system after every request from my customer, a new feature or bug fix, not while I was developing it but after I developed it.
This is because whenever a new feature or refactoring is implemented, each unit of the project needs to be tested from scratch, and this really creates an unscalable time complexity as the project grows.

## So What ?

Actually, in this project, I tried to use Automated Testing, which I want to do myself, which I think will improve me and which is a must-know subject for a software developer.
For each domain / class under the Fundamentals folder, I have created / will create their tests using the NUnit Test Runner to find the corresponding Tests project.
